This folder contains the project created within a group in a course titled 'Game Engine Architecture'.

In this task we were tasked to create an original project using the unreal engine. We were given complete creative freedom.
We decided to create a StarFox(tm) type space shooter that ended up being reminiscent of the space battles of Star Wars
Battlefront 2(also tm). I hope you enjoy as we had a blast designing each aspect (my personal favorite are the stars).

We even made a bit of a trailer for it which you can view at the following link:
