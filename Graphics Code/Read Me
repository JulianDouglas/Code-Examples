This Folder contains two projects. One project contains work completed for an 'Advanced Graphic Programming' class.
This class covered topics such as textures, materials, lighting, and the like using the OpenGl framework. Included in the first folder
are a couple individual assignments as well as the final project for the class. The requirements of these projects had us write
the project code in a single file (which drove the entire class crazy).

The second folder contains my current in progress project which when finished will be a custom shader compiler. The goal for this project
is to create a personal tool for shader production and compilation. It is in it's earliest stages of development, but I hope to finish
it soon.
